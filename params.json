  "body": "# The FPL Portal \r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThe project for creating and Android App, which will cater to the various managerial jobs that are associated with our very decorated FPL (Friend's Premier League) played in the computer game FIFA. This app will handle functionalities like maintaining custom team lists, player lists, transfer markets, player bidding, team management, etc. \r\n\r\n## Functionality\r\n\r\nThe app is targeted to meet the following requirements and functionalities -\r\n- Team Management - including viewing current squad, viewing player average based slots that are available in the team currently, etc.\r\n- Player bids and Transfers - This is the most exciting feature of the app. This was earlier carried out in a manual method and resulted in a lot of hassles. The sole purpose of this app was to create an engine that would engage managers through itself and automate player transfers. A very powerful search algorithm is implemented which gives the manager a vast array of options while searching for players to bid on.\r\n- Wishlist, notifications and suggested players - The app also has other powerful algorithms to study the general trend of a manager, the type of player he searches for and suggest players accordingly. Notifications is an integral part of this app. The more managers get engaged, the more powerful the notification engine becomes. Also, managers can save players to wishlist for future transactions.\r\n- This app also keeps record of all data related to transfers and finances spent by a manager throughout the transfer markets that he has been present. This helps create a relative data among managers.\r\n\r\n## Technical Specifications \r\n\r\n- The app has been built on and only for Android users\r\n- The app's minimum supported SDK is API 16: Android 4.1 (JellyBean) targeted only for phone devices\r\n- The app does not use extensive graphic material\r\n\r\n## Support \r\n\r\nKaustav Banerjee (kaustavbanerjee4u@gmail.com)\r\nSubhrajyoti Sen (subhrajyoti42@gmail.com)",
